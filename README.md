## 🚀 System Requirements & Features



### 1. User Dashboard

* **View Trains**: Users can view a list of available trains, including destinations and departure times.

* **Live Availability**: The dashboard filters trains to show only those with seats available (`seats_available > 0`).



### 2. Ticket Booking System

* **Booking Processing**: Handles ticket reservations by linking users to trains.

* **Inventory Management**: Automatically decrements the `seats_available` count upon a successful booking.



### 3. Administrator Module

* **Audit Logs**: Admins can view a secure log of all booking activities, including the user's IP address and email.

* **Role-Based Access**: The `/admin/logs` route is protected and only accessible to users with the `admin` role.



---



## 📜 Business Rules



The system enforces the following strict validation rules as found in the `BookingController`:



### Passport Validation

* **Rule**: Passport numbers must strictly follow the format: **Start with 1 Uppercase Letter, followed by 7 to 9 digits**.

* **Regex Implementation**: `/^[A-Z][0-9]{7,9}$/`



### Seat Limits

* A user can book a **minimum of 1** and a **maximum of 5** seats per transaction.



### Availability Check

* The system prevents overbooking by verifying that `seats_available` is greater than or equal to the requested seats before processing.



---



## 💻 Tech Stack



* **Framework**: Laravel 12.0+

* **Language**: PHP 8.2+

* **Frontend**: Blade Templates, Tailwind CSS

* **Database**: SQLite (default) or MySQL



---



## 🛠 Installation Guide



The project includes a convenient setup script in `composer.json` to automate the installation process.



### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash

git clone <your-repo-url>

cd train-booking-system



## About Laravel



Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:



- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).

- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).

- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.

- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).

- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).

- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).

- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).



Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
